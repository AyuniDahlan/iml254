            <h1>CRAZY PEOPLE</h1>
            <p>We have a group of friends called "crazy people." This group was founded in 2018 because we became close that year. It all started with the four of us being in the same class in high school. We made many beautiful memories together during that time. When our school days ended, the four of us went our separate ways: Ayuni and Azu, also known as Zubaidah, are still pursuing diploma programs at different UiTM campuses in different states. Meanwhile, Zahirah and Arissa have continued their studies at the bachelor's level at different universities. Despite going our separate ways, we make it a point to meet and spend time together whenever we get long breaks and our schedules align. These reunions are precious to us, and when I am with them, I feel like time flies and it envies us for the joy we share.</p>

<h2>Point of View about Me from My Beloved Friends</h2>
<h3>From Zahirah</h3>   
<img src="image/friends1.jpg" alt="Zahirah" style="width: 10%; height: 20%;">

     <p>You are a kind and friendly person (I wouldn't say you're quiet because so far I've seen a change from introvert to extrovert/ambivert). You always appear happy in front of others but you keep your feelings to yourself in silence. Somehow, if you feel comfortable sharing, then you will open up (Feel free to do that because I'm going to support you no matter what happens). And then you need to be a bit more strict and firm in whatever you do. it's just to help you stand up for yourself. Whatever you do, I'll support you okay, like I said above!! Then, I love the vibes when you're calm while taking pictures of the clouds (this is another side that I like, it's like you have a perfect connection with nature) </p>

<h3>From Zubaidah</h3>   
<img src="image/friends2.jpeg" alt="Zubaidah" style="width: 10%; height: 20%;">

     <p>Ayuni values her friends quite a lot, maybe it seems hard to see it at first but when you think about it, it can be obvious. She was quite but just to strangers, when with someone she hold dear and comfortable with you will see another side of her, she is cheerfull and kind. However dont test her patient, if she love you enough maybe she will let it slide but its not really good to be on people bad side right. As a friend that been there with her and had seen few of her phases in life, I could say that she has grown into a beatiful strong lady. Whatever hardship that came into her door she would face it bravely and would never give up. Did I mention that she is a hardworking person? yes, Ayuni is very strict and organise when it comes to work, she would take her job seriously and you would rarely get dissappointed with her work. She is someone who loves to be around nature, it gives her a sense of calmness and could heals all the problems that she might have difficulties to face on, taking a break by reconnecting with the nature was very ideal and I like that part of her. I am really grateful to be one of her friends, I learnt many great things together with her and she is the friend that you would not want to lost on. May Allah protect our friendship fil dunya wal akhirah. </p>

<h3>From Arissa</h3>   
<img src="image/friends3.jpeg" alt="Arissa" style="width: 10%; height: 20%;">

     <p>I know you as an introvert person and you don't talk much with others, but somehow when we are together i can feel how comfortable you are to share your feelings and stories. To see your true side is the best thing about you. Not only that, you're a pure innocent and kind hearted girl I've met. I have never seen you do something bad to others but instead, you still helping them whenever they are in need even after how they treat you. I would love to say that, you have done great! don't ever feel down about things that doesn't go as you plan but take that as a lesson for you so that you can do even better in the future. I'm  sorry, i may not be around much with you but I will always be there for you whenever you need me. Thank you for being my bestfriend for the past 6 years. Thank you for being the best deskmate that i ever had. I really enjoy sitting with you, gossiping together, do things together with you. Thank you for always supporting me and willingly listen to me yapping about nonsense but still hyping me up. I'm sorry again if i ever be a burden to you. I wish you the best in life and your future. May all the ace's be there in your life! love you!! </p>
