            <h1>About AYUNII</h1>
            <p>I enjoy the peace and quiet of nature, as well as the simplicity of peaceful times. I have an intense love for quiet vibes and frequently seek out calming locations where I can recharge and reflect on. One of my favourite pleasures is photographing the beauty of the world around me, particularly stunning places that inspire a sense of serenity and admiration. The sound and sight of rain have never disappointed me, and I frequently make recordings of rainy days to capture the relaxing atmosphere they create. My appreciation for these peaceful, thoughtful times is a crucial component of who I am, impacting both my activities and my perspective on life.</p>

            <p>Ayu loves in quiet situations. Ayu prefers the calming hum of quiet over the chaotic environment of large crowds and seeks safety in times of serenity and peace. This dislike to noise extends to others as well Ayu avoids toxic and manipulative persons, seeking true and honest relationships.</p>

            <p>Rainy days hold a special charm for Ayu. The rhythmic patter of rain against the window and the fresh, earthy scent that follows a downpour bring a sense of calm and contentment. It's during these moments that Ayu feels most inspired, often grabbing a phone camera to capture the beauty of the rain-soaked world. The sight of raindrops clinging to leaves, the way puddles reflect the sky, and the gentle, muted colors of a rainy day are all scenes Ayu loves to record.</p>

            <p>While Ayu appreciates the simplicity and quiet beauty of nature, there's also a sweet side. Sometimes, indulging in a treat brings a simple joy—a piece of soft cookie, a slice of cake, or a scoop of ice cream. These small pleasures add a touch of sweetness to life's calm moments.</p>

            <p>In essence, Ayu is a person who finds beauty in stillness, values authenticity, and delights in the small, often overlooked wonders of the world. Whether it’s a rainy afternoon or a quiet evening, Ayu embraces these moments with a thoughtful and observant heart.</p>
